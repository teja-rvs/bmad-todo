**Date:** 2026-02-18  
**Epic:** 5 — Accessibility and responsive experience  
**Project:** bmad-todo  
**Facilitator:** Bob (Scrum Master)

## 1. Epic summary and metrics

| Metric | Value |
|--------|--------|
| Total stories | 4 |
| Completed | 4 |
| Completion | 100% |
| Blockers | 0 |
| Technical debt items (called out) | 0 |

**Stories delivered:**
- 5.1 — Keyboard and focus: full keyboard operability
- 5.2 — Screen reader and semantics: labels, roles, live regions
- 5.3 — Visual accessibility: WCAG 2.1 AA contrast and focus
- 5.4 — Responsive layout: desktop and mobile viewports

**Business outcomes:** User can use the app with keyboard only, with a screen reader, on desktop and mobile, in supported browsers, with visual presentation meeting WCAG 2.1 Level AA (FR18–FR23, NFR-A1–A3). Ready for Epic 6 (SPA behavior and error feedback).

## 2. Deep story analysis — patterns

### 2.1 Dev notes and implementation

- **5.1:** Frontend-only; tab order (add input → Add button → task checkboxes), Enter/Space behavior, focus-visible rings. Code review: focus-return assertion (Add button path), no-focus-trap assertion, contrast comments.
- **5.2:** Accessible names (visible label, aria-label), list semantics (ul/li, role="list"), live region (role="status", aria-live="polite") for task added/complete. Code review: removed redundant aria-label on input, added vitest-axe, live region clear after 2s.
- **5.3:** Contrast audit (placeholder, border, EmptyState, completed state #556b1c); focus rings verified. Code review: checkbox accent, EmptyState h2, docs (contrast-ratios.md), a11y e2e.
- **5.4:** Viewport meta, mobile-first container (max-width 40rem), 44×44px touch targets, no horizontal scroll. E2E for 320/375/768/1280 and touch targets. Code review: viewport coverage, EmptyState min-w-0, break-words.

### 2.2 Review feedback patterns

- **Accessibility:** Redundant ARIA removed; visible labels preferred; list and live region semantics confirmed; contrast and focus documented.
- **Testing:** Unit tests → vitest-axe (5.2) → a11y e2e (5.3) → viewport/touch e2e (5.4). Code reviews consistently asked for test coverage and file lists.
- **Documentation:** contrast-ratios.md and accessibility-verification.md created; AC and WCAG references kept in story files.

### 2.3 Lessons learned

1. **Layered a11y** — Keyboard/focus (5.1) then semantics/live region (5.2) then contrast (5.3) then responsive (5.4) avoided rework and kept scope clear.
2. **Code review value** — Redundant ARIA, contrast gaps, and missing e2e/viewport tests were caught in review across multiple stories.
3. **Reuse over redo** — Each story built on the previous (AddRow, TaskRow, TaskList, App) without breaking existing behavior.
4. **Docs for compliance** — Recording contrast ratios and a11y verification made WCAG 2.1 AA decisions auditable and repeatable.

### 2.4 Technical debt and testing

- **Technical debt:** None blocking. Story files retain `{{agent_model_name_version}}` placeholders (cosmetic).
- **Testing:** Unit tests for components and App; vitest-axe for a11y; e2e a11y and viewport/touch-target coverage. All tests passing; no regressions from Epic 3.

## 3. Previous retrospective follow-through

No Epic 4 retrospective exists in this project (Epic 4 was not implemented; roadmap went 1 → 2 → 3 → 5 → 6). Therefore no prior action items were tracked for this retrospective.

---

## 4. Next epic preview — Epic 6: SPA behavior and error feedback

**Epic 6 objective:** The app behaves as an SPA (no full-page reloads for core flows) and surfaces clear feedback when the service is unavailable (FR24–FR25, NFR-R2).

**Stories:** 6.1 — SPA behavior (no full-page reloads for core flows); 6.2 — Error feedback (service unavailable and retry).

**Dependencies on Epic 5:** None new. Client already uses client-side state and refetch/merge after mutations; Epic 6 formalizes SPA behavior and adds user-facing error/retry handling.

**Risks / unknowns:** Low. Architecture and PRD already specify fetch-after-mutation and “service unavailable” messaging; implementation is alignment and UX polish.

## 5. Action items and commitments

### Process

- **E2E and a11y in definition of done:** Continue running e2e (app + a11y) and viewport checks before marking stories done; keep file lists and completion notes in story artifacts.
- **Code review before done:** Keep current practice: story moves to done only after code review and test updates.

### Technical

- **No new technical debt** from Epic 5. Contrast and a11y docs (e.g. contrast-ratios.md) should be updated if palette or components change in future epics.

### Documentation

- **Accessibility and contrast:** When changing Warm Minimal palette or focus/contrast rules, update `docs/contrast-ratios.md` and `docs/accessibility-verification.md` so WCAG 2.1 AA remains traceable.

## 6. Readiness assessment

| Area | Status |
|------|--------|
| Testing & quality | E2E (app + a11y) and viewport tests in place; all passing. |
| Deployment | Not run in this retro; per project, deploy TBD. |
| Stakeholder acceptance | Per PRD, personal use; no formal sign-off required for MVP. |
| Technical health | Stable; frontend-only changes; no regressions. |
| Unresolved blockers | None. |

**Conclusion:** Epic 5 is complete from a story and quality perspective. No critical path items blocking Epic 6.

## 7. Key takeaways

1. **Accessibility as a sequence** — Keyboard → semantics → contrast → responsive gave a clear order and avoided rework.
2. **Reviews improved quality** — Redundant ARIA, contrast, and test coverage were repeatedly improved in code review.
3. **Documentation supports compliance** — Contrast and a11y docs make WCAG 2.1 AA decisions repeatable for future changes.
4. **Epic 6 is unblocked** — SPA and error feedback build on current client/API patterns; no prep work required.

---

**Retrospective complete.**  
Next: Begin Epic 6 when ready (create stories via SM agent; ensure critical path items, if any, are done first).
